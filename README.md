# Library Management System in C++

A robust, command-line based Library Management System built with C++, designed to demonstrate the effective use of core data structures for efficient data handling and management.

## About The Project

This project is a console application that simulates a simple library management environment. It allows users to manage records of books and students, providing essential functionalities like adding new entries, searching for specific records, and displaying lists of available books or registered students.

The core of this system is built upon fundamental data structures to ensure optimized performance and functionality.

### Key Features

*   **Student & Book Management:** Add, update, and manage records for both students and library books.
*   **Efficient Search:** Utilizes a **linked list** to store student records, allowing for quick and efficient searching through the database.
*   **Optimized Data Structures:** Incorporates key C++ concepts and data structures such as **linked lists**, **arrays**, **pointers**, and **trees** to build a functional and performant system.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** A clean and straightforward interface for easy user interaction.

### Built With

*   C++

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need a C++ compiler installed on your machine (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).

### Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3.  **Compile the source code:**
    *(Replace `main.cpp` with the name of your main source file if it's different)*
    ```sh
    g++ main.cpp -o library_system
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    ./library_system
    ```
